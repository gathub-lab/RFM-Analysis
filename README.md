# RFM-Analysis
## 1. Introduction
### Why RFM?
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing model using customer segmentation based on their transaction history.
This model could be very useful, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited marketing resources, helping them focus on the potentially right customer segments to increase ROI, reduce churn, reduce cost, improve customer relationship, and a lot more.
### How?
In RFM analysis, customers are scored based on three factors (Recency - how recently, Frequency - how often, Monetary - how much), then labeled based on the combination of RFM scores.

## Context
SuperStore Company is a global retail company - Global. So the company has a lot of customers.
On the occasion of Christmas and New Year, the Marketing Department wants to run marketing campaigns to thank customers for supporting the company during the past time. As well as exploit potential customers to become loyal customers.

However, the Marketing Department has not yet been able to group each customer this year because the data set is too large to be processed manually as in previous years, so we asked the Data Analysis Department to assist in implementing a classification problem. segment of each customer to deploy each marketing program suitable for each customer group.

The Marketing Director also proposed using the RFM model, but in the past, when the company was small, the team could calculate and classify it by themselves using excel. Currently the amount of data is too large, so it is expected that the Data Department will build a flow to implement Segmentation evaluation through Python programming.

## Steps to approach the problem:
1. Prepare data set suitable for RFM model.
"2. Determine how to calculate and calculate the R, F, M score of each customer.
"3. Provide a calculation with a score corresponding to a scale of 1 to 5 using the quintile method of Statistics."
4. Based on the classification table to group for each customer
5. Visualize the number of segment sets with data dimensions - Dimension
6. Analyze the current situation of the company and give suggestions to the Marketing team
7. Suggestions to the Marketing and Sales team with the retail model of Superstore company, which index should be most interested in in the 3 R, F, and M indexes?

## 2. Data Visualization with Python(Matplotlip)
